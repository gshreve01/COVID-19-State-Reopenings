# CovidProject2

For this project we wanted to gather data about Covid 19 and its spread along with information about lockdowns and other things states were doing to limit the spread.  We gathered information through API's, reading in CSV files, and scraping the web using Pandas and beautiful soup. We organized and prepped the data to be stored into a SQLAlchemy Relational Database before utilizing that data to create visualizations and try to understand how states various measures to prevent the spread were impacting the spread.  We created visualizations using JavaScript and D3 as well as Tableau.  Lastly, we compiled it to create a Flask Application.  Currently, the application is not live so you would need to follow the steps below to spin it up.


# When you create the database you will need to name it COVID19

# All of the data collection and organization is under the modules files within the ETL

# When you run the flask app.py you will be prompted for user and pass of POSTGRES before it loads
